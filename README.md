# Install Software Using Powershell Script
This is my first trial to learn powershell script. I often to clean install my pc with various custom windows build. Therefore, i must reinstall all the app that I want to use.
That's why i wonder how to install all of those app with just one click a executor or script.
I searched and found that it can be done by using Powershell Script. So I try to make my own script, then I can customize it according to my needs.

### This script just a beginning, still need to edit the script everytime used, not too much to look forward to
What does it do?:
- Install software automatically from specified directory or from link internet that also has been specified in script.
- Create log after run the script
